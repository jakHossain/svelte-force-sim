# ForceMap Testing with Svelte and D3 Force simulations

This is honestly just a playground repository to test out different ways to try to create force simulation graphics is a svelte-friendly and componetized way.

Currently we have a [`ForceMap.svelte`](./src/forceMap/ForceMap.svelte) whose goal is to provide a grid-based positioning system to help anchor force-simulated components.

More to come if I have time...
